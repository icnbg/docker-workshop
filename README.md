### Examples

	git clone https://github.com/icnbg/docker-workshop.git
	
Nodejs Hello:v1:

	docker images
	docker pull redis && docker pull php:5-apache && docker pull node
	docker images

	cd docker-workshop
	cd hello_v1
	npm install
	export EXPOSE_PORT=8080
	node hello.js
	---
	rm -rf node_modules/
	docker build -t hello:v1 .
	docker run -d --name hello-node1 -p 8080:8080 -e "EXPOSE_PORT=8080" hello:v1
	docker ps
	curl localhost:8080
	docker logs hello-node1


Nodejs Hello:v2:

	cd ../hello_v2
	cat Dockerfile
	docker build -t hello:v2 .
	docker run -d --name hello-node2 -p 8081:8081 -e "EXPOSE_PORT=8081" hello:v2
	docker ps
	Oops?
	docker ps -a
	docker logs hello-node2
	docker rm hello-node2

### Immutable Servers/Infrastructure

Immutable Servers are a deployment model that mandates that no application updates, security patches, or configuration changes happen on production systems. If any of these layers needs to be modified, a new image is constructed, pushed and cycled into production. When you deploy an update to your application, you should create new instances (servers and/or containers) and destroy the old ones, instead of trying to upgrade them in-place. Once your application is running, you donâ€™t touch it! The benefits come in the form of repeatability, reduced management overhead, easier rollbacks, etc.


### Microservices

A microservice is an isolated, loosely-coupled unit of development that works on a single concern. This is similar to the old "Unix" way of doing things: do one thing, and do it well. Matters such as how to "combine" whatever is provided by the service are left to higher layers or to policy. This usually means that microservices tend to avoid interdependencies: if one microservice has a hard requirement for other microservices, then you should ask yourself if it makes sense to make them all part of the same unit.
